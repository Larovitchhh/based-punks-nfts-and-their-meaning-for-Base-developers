Low-Cost Transactions: Base’s Layer 2 scaling reduces gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet, making it ideal for NFT minting, trading, and dApp development.

EVM Compatibility: Base is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to use familiar tools (e.g., Solidity, Hardhat) to build NFT-related smart contracts.

Ecosystem Growth: Projects like Based Punks demonstrate Base’s growing NFT ecosystem, encouraging developers to create dApps, marketplaces, or tools for NFT collectors and creators.

Community and Grants: Base supports NFT projects through initiatives like the Base Builder Grants, which funded Based Punks, signaling opportunities for developers to innovate in this space
